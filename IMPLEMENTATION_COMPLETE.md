## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for blazing fast builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Backend
- **Supabase** for everything:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Authentication (email/password)
  - Storage (retina images)
  - Edge Functions (AI analysis)
  - Real-time subscriptions

### Edge Function
- **analyze-retina** - Processes uploaded scans
  - Receives scan ID and image URLs
  - Updates scan with AI prediction
  - Returns structured results

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: AI Model Integration

### Current Setup
The Edge Function `/functions/v1/analyze-retina` is deployed and ready. It currently:
- Receives `scanId` and `imageUrls[]`
- Updates the `scans` table with AI results
- Returns mock predictions

### To Connect Your AI Model

#### Option 1: Update Edge Function Directly
1. **Locate**: `supabase/functions/analyze-retina/index.ts`
2. **Replace** the mock prediction logic with your model API
3. **Deploy**: Use the Supabase dashboard or CLI

Example structure:
```typescript
// Instead of mock data:
const mockPrediction = "No DR detected";

// Call your AI model:
const response = await fetch('YOUR_MODEL_API_URL', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ images: imageUrls })
});

const aiResult = await response.json();

// Update scan with real results
await supabase
  .from('scans')
  .update({
    ai_prediction: aiResult.prediction,
    ai_confidence: aiResult.confidence,
    ai_details: aiResult.details
  })
  .eq('id', scanId);
```

#### Option 2: External AI Service
1. Host your model on:
   - **Hugging Face Inference API**
   - **Google Cloud AI**
   - **AWS SageMaker**
   - **Custom server**

2. Update the Edge Function to call your endpoint
3. Pass the retina image URLs
4. Store results in the `scans` table

#### AI Model Response Format
Your model should return:
```json
{
  "prediction": "Moderate Non-Proliferative DR",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "details": {
    "severity": "moderate",
    "findings": ["microaneurysms", "hemorrhages"],
    "recommendation": "Follow-up in 3 months"
  }
}
```

### Database Fields for AI
- `ai_prediction` (text) - Main diagnosis
- `ai_confidence` (numeric) - 0.0 to 1.0
- `ai_details` (jsonb) - Structured additional data

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Already Implemented
- ✅ RLS policies on all tables
- ✅ Auth checks in all queries
- ✅ Secure file uploads to storage
- ✅ Role-based UI rendering
- ✅ Environment variables for secrets

### Remember
- Never expose Supabase service role key client-side
- Keep AI model API keys in Edge Function only
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive:
- **Mobile**: Single column layouts, touch-friendly buttons
- **Tablet**: 2-column grids
- **Desktop**: 3-column grids, full navigation

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors
Edit Tailwind gradients in each dashboard file:
- **Patient**: `from-blue-50 via-cyan-50 to-teal-50`
- **Nurse**: `from-emerald-50 via-teal-50 to-cyan-50`
- **Doctor**: `from-purple-50 via-pink-50 to-rose-50`

### Add Features
All code is modular and well-organized:
- `/src/pages/` - Dashboard components
- `/src/contexts/` - Auth and Theme
- `/src/lib/` - Supabase client
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails
- Check storage bucket `retina-images` exists
- Verify RLS policies allow inserts
- Ensure file is valid image format

### AI Analysis Not Working
- Check Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
- Verify function is deployed
- Test function endpoint directly

### Auth Issues
- Clear browser localStorage
- Check Supabase Auth settings
- Verify email confirmation is disabled
